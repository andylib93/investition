# Investition

I try to translate the formulas taught in one of my university lectures "Investition" *(engl: investion)* into little Python scripts to learn both at the same time. Nothing else tbh.

## Usage

Every script can be used as an executable, meaning a simple ```./script.py``` in your Terminal should suffice.<br>
If not ```chmod 755 script.py``` does the trick on **macOS** and **Linux** - for **Windows** follow the instuctions on [Superuser](https://superuser.com/questions/106181/equivalent-of-chmod-to-change-file-permissions-in-windows).<br>
The ultimate **fallback** of course is using the python interpreter: ```python3 script.py```.<br>
Install Python [here](https://python.org).<br>
The next important step to look out for is that every variable (usually written in CAPITALS) needs to be manually set if you would like to use your own numbers.<br>
Also comment out every function that you don't want to be executed with a ```#```-Symbol, like ```#print(functionCall)```.<br>
I make use of the ```print()```-statement for printing the ```return```-value.<br><br>
That'll be all for now, ```happy learning``` ðŸ¤“
